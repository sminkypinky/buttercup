        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800">Our Mission</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">At Buttercup, our mission is to harness the profound power of music to improve the lives of individuals living with dementia and their families. We believe that every melody has the potential to unlock a treasure trove of memories, emotions, and connections that dementia may have obscured but not erased.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800">The Science Behind Music and Memory</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Research has shown that music can have a remarkable impact on individuals with dementia. The areas of the brain responsible for musical memory often remain relatively preserved, even as other cognitive functions decline. This means that familiar songs can:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
            <li>Evoke strong emotions and memories</li>
            <li>Reduce anxiety and depression</li>
            <li>Improve mood and cognitive function</li>
            <li>Enhance social interactions and communication</li>
            <li>Potentially alleviate some behavioral symptoms associated with dementia</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By creating personalized playlists, we aim to tap into these benefits and provide a non-pharmacological approach to enhancing the quality of life for those affected by dementia.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800">How Buttercup Works</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Buttercup uses a sophisticated algorithm that takes into account:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
            <li>Birth year and month to identify songs from formative years (ages 10-30)</li>
            <li>Country of origin to include culturally relevant music</li>
            <li>Historical events that might have emotional significance</li>
            <li>Popular genres and artists from different periods of the individual's life</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By combining these factors, we create a unique musical journey that reflects the individual's life experiences and cultural background.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Families and caregivers have reported remarkable moments when using personalized playlists:</p>

            <li>Increased engagement and alertness during and after listening sessions</li>
            <li>Improved mood and reduced agitation</li>
            <li>Moments of lucidity and recognition, often leading to meaningful interactions with loved ones</li>
